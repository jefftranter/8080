This is the source code for the Heathkit H88/H891 monitor ROM (MTR88). It
was based on the published source code with minimal changes to adapt
it to the ASL assembler. The listing is in split octal, like the
original Heathkit assembler listing.

Some source code (for the memory test and and floppy disk rotational
speed test) was not published in the Heathkit manuals. It has been
reverse engineered in this code from the Heathkit ROMs.

I have confirmed that the output matches the published binary for the
ROM.
