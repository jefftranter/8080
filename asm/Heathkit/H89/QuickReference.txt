General
-------

Monitor prompt is "H:".
You only type the first letter of each command.
Addresses are in split octal format.
<DELETE> will cancel a partially entered command.
<RIGHT SHIFT><RESET> will reset the machine.

Monitor Commands
----------------

B[oot] [<drive>] <RETURN>

Boot from floppy drive. The optional value of <drive> can be 0, 1, 2,
or 3 for primary boot device or 'S' followed 0, 1, 2, or 3 to boot
from drive on secondary device.

G[o] [<address>] <RETURN>

Start execution at <address>.
If <address> is omitted, starts from Program Counter address.

P[rogram Counter] [<address>] <RETURN>

Set program counter address.
If <address> is omitted, displays current address which can
subsequently be changed.

S[ubstitute] <address> <RETURN>

Display memory at location <address>.
Type in a new octal byte value to write to current address,
<space> moves to next address,
'-' moves to previous address,
<RETURN> exits to monitor prompt.

Other Notes
-----------

Write a HLT instruction (octal 166) to an address to set a breakpoint
to stop execution and enter monitor during debugging. To continue
execution, write original byte back to the address, use the P command
to set the PC to one less than it's current value, then use the G[o]
command.

Run memory test: G[o] 7375

Run disk speed test: G[o] 7372

With the MTR-88 monitor ROM, there are cassette tape L[oad] and D[ump]
commands and the B[oot] command does not take any options.

With the MTR-90 monitor ROM, there are additional commands C[onvert]
(converts between hex and octal), I[n] (input from port), O[ut]
(output to port), R[adix] (set radix to octal or hex), T[est] (test
memory), and V[iew} (view memory). Commands accept values in the
currently selected radix (hex or octal).
