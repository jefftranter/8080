This is the source code for the Heathkit H19 terminal ROM (also used
on the H88 and H89 computers). It was based on the published source
code with minimal changes to adapt it to the ASL assembler. The
listing is in split octal, like the original Heathkit assembler
listing.

I have confirmed that the output matches the published binary for the
ROM.
