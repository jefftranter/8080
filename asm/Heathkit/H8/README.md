This is the source code for the Heathkit H8 monitor ROM (PAM-8). It
was based on the published source code with minimal changes to adapt
it to the ASL assembler. The listing is in split octal, like the
original Heathkit assembler listing.

I have confirmed that the output matches the published binary for the
ROM.
