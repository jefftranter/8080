General
-------

Monitor prompt is "H:".
You only type the first letter of each command.
Addresses are in split octal or hex format depending on the selected base.
<DELETE> will cancel a partially entered command.
<RIGHT SHIFT><RESET> will reset the machine.

Monitor Commands
----------------

B[oot] [<drive>] <RETURN>

Boot from disk drive. The optional value of <drive> can be a numeric
unit number to boot from the primary device, or "S" followed by an
optional unit number to boot from a secondary device. The unit number
can be optionally followed by a command string beginning with a colon.
The default boot device is determined by DIP switch settings.

C[onvert] <address> <RETURN>

Converts a 16-bit number specified in the opposite radix to the
currently selected radix (as determined by the R[adix] command).

G[o] [<address>] <RETURN>

Start execution at <address>, specified in the current radix.
If <address> is omitted, starts from Program Counter address.

I[in] <port> <RETURN>

Inputs from the i/o port specified by <port> in the current radix and
displays the result.

O[ut] <port>,<data> <RETURN>

Outputs the specified <data> to the input/output port specified by
<port> (both in the current radix).

P[rogram Counter] [<address>] <RETURN>

Set program counter address, specified in the current radix.
If <address> is omitted, displays current address which can
subsequently be changed.

R[adix] [O|H] <RETURN>

With no arguments, displays the current radix, Octal or Hexadecimal.
With an O or H argument, sets the radix to split octal or hexadecimal,
respectively.

S[ubstitute] <address> <RETURN>

Display memory at location <address>.
Type in a new byte value to write to current address,
<space> moves to next address,
'-' moves to previous address,
<RETURN> exits to monitor prompt.
The address and data are specified using the current radix.

T[est] <RETURN>

Initiate a RAM memory test.

V[iew] <start>,<end> <RETURN>

Display a block of memory in the current radix and in ASCII from
address <start> to <end>. If <start> or <end> is omitted, they default
to zero. Displays 128 bytes in octal or 256 bytes in hexadecimal.
Subsequent V[iew] commands with no arguments display the next block of
memory.

Other Notes
-----------

Write a HLT instruction (octal 166) to an address to set a breakpoint
to stop execution and enter monitor during debugging. To continue
execution, write original byte back to the address, use the P command
to set the PC to one less than it's current value, then use the G[o]
command.

Run memory test: G[o] 7375

Run disk speed test: G[o] 7372

With the MTR-88 monitor ROM, there are cassette tape L[oad] and D[ump]
commands and the B[oot] command does not take any options.

With the MTR-89 monitor ROM, the [In], O[ut], R[adix], T[est], and
V[iew] commands are not available, the B[oot] command only accepts a
numeric drive number, and values are always in octal.
